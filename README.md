Telegram_Chat_GPT ü§ñ

A simple Telegram bot that uses OpenAI's GPT model to chat and interact with users. This project allows you to create your own intelligent chatbot on Telegram using Python.

üöÄ Setup Instructions
Follow these steps carefully to get your Telegram ChatGPT bot up and running:

1. Create a Telegram Bot
Open Telegram and search for BotFather.

Start the chat and send the command /newbot.

Follow the instructions to choose a name and username for your bot.

Once created, BotFather will give you a bot token.
 Save this token somewhere safe.

2. Set Up Your Project Folder
Create a folder on your PC for your project files.
(If you want the bot to run 24/7, you‚Äôll need a VPS or cloud server to host it.)

3. Install Python
Download and install Python from python.org.
‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation.
(Skip this step if Python is already installed.)

4. Set Up the Environment
Open your code editor (e.g., VS Code) and navigate to your project folder:
cd path/to/your/telegram_ai_bot

Create a virtual environment:
python -m venv .venv
Activate the virtual environment:

Command Prompt (Windows):
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat

PowerShell (Windows):
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

Install the required Python packages:
pip install python-telegram-bot openai

5. Get Your OpenAI API Key
Visit OpenAI Platform.

Sign in or create an account, then generate an API key.

Save this key securely ‚Äî you'll need it to connect to OpenAI's GPT model.

6. Create and Run the Bot
Create a new Python file (e.g., main.py).

Copy the code from the provided main.py in this repository.

Replace the placeholders for your Telegram bot token and OpenAI API key with your own.

Run the bot:
python main.py

‚úÖ You're All Set!
Your Telegram bot should now be running and ready to chat using GPT.
Feel free to improve it or deploy it on a VPS for continuous operation.
